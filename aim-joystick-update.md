# Aim Joystick Implementation Summary

## Overview
Successfully converted the right-side fire button into a dual-purpose joystick that handles both aiming and shooting. When touched, it starts continuous shooting and allows the player to control aim direction by dragging.

## Changes Made

### 1. Added Missing Icon Definitions (SvgIcons.ts)
- Added `ARROW_UP` and `CROSSHAIR` to the IconType enum
- Added corresponding SVG path definitions for both icons

### 2. Updated MobileControls.ts Structure
- Replaced `shootButton` with `aimJoystick` and `aimJoystickKnob` elements
- Added aim position tracking variables (`aimStartPos`, `aimCurrentPos`)
- Changed `isShootingActive` to `isAimActive`

### 3. Implemented Aim Joystick Touch Handling
- `handleAimStart`: Captures initial touch, starts continuous shooting
- `handleAimUpdate`: Updates joystick knob position and player aim direction
- `handleAimEnd`: Stops shooting and resets joystick to center
- `updateAimJoystickPosition`: Calculates joystick displacement and converts to aim angle

### 4. Visual Updates
- Styled aim joystick with red theme (matching the original shoot button color)
- Crosshair icon centered in the joystick
- Active state styling when shooting
- Responsive sizing that matches the movement joystick

### 5. Technical Implementation Details
- Reuses existing joystick mechanics from movement joystick
- Calculates aim angle using `Math.atan2(dy, dx)` where dx/dy are touch offset from center
- Only updates aim direction when joystick is moved beyond 20% of radius (dead zone)
- Maintains continuous shooting while joystick is active
- Resets to center position when released

## Features
- Touch and drag to aim in any direction
- Automatic shooting starts on touch
- Visual feedback with knob movement
- Haptic feedback on supported devices
- Desktop mouse support for testing
- Responsive sizing based on viewport

## Usage
1. Touch the right joystick to start shooting
2. Drag to aim in any direction
3. Release to stop shooting

The implementation provides intuitive dual-stick controls for mobile devices, with the left stick controlling movement and the right stick controlling aiming and shooting.
