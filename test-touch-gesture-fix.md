# Touch Gesture Fix Test Plan

## Issue
When using virtual joysticks on touchscreen, sliding too far up sometimes activates canvas zoom functionality, causing conflicts.

## Solution Implemented
1. Added `isJoystickActive()` and `getActiveTouchIds()` methods to MobileControls
2. Store MobileControls reference in Game class
3. Modified TouchGestureManager to:
   - Check if joysticks are active before processing touches
   - Disable canvas gestures entirely when any joystick is active
   - Re-enable gestures when joysticks are released

## Testing Steps
1. Load the game on a touchscreen device or use Chrome DevTools mobile emulation
2. Start using the movement joystick (left side)
3. While holding the joystick, slide your finger upward beyond the joystick boundary
4. Verify that canvas zoom/pinch gestures are NOT triggered
5. Release the joystick
6. Try pinch-to-zoom on the canvas - it should work normally
7. Repeat test with the aim joystick (right side)
8. Test multi-touch: use one joystick while trying to pinch with other fingers

## Expected Behavior
- Canvas gestures (zoom, pan) should be completely disabled while any joystick is active
- Joysticks should work smoothly without triggering canvas gestures
- Canvas gestures should work normally when joysticks are not being used

## Code Changes
- `Game.ts`: Added mobileControls field and getter/setter methods
- `SimpleGameUI.ts`: Store MobileControls reference in Game
- `MobileControls.ts`: Added joystick state methods and gesture manager notifications
- `TouchGestureManager.ts`: Check for active joysticks before processing touches
