# Canvas Rendering Debug Summary

## Issue
The canvas is not rendering on the game page.

## Debugging Steps Taken:

1. **Fixed CSS class** - Added the missing `.image-crisp-edges` class that was referenced in the canvas element

2. **Fixed container styling** - Added explicit background color and dimensions to the canvas container

3. **Fixed root layout** - Changed from `h-full` to `fixed inset-0` to ensure the root component fills the viewport

4. **Added debug logging** - Added console logs to track container and canvas dimensions

## Key Components:

1. **Container Hierarchy**:
   - `#app-container` (100vw x 100vh, fixed position)
   - Router root div (fixed inset-0)
   - Game route div (h-screen)
   - `#canvas-container` (absolute positioned, bottom-[60px] for control bar)
   - Canvas element (w-full h-full)

2. **Canvas Setup**:
   - Canvas dimensions are set based on container rect
   - Pixel ratio scaling is applied
   - Renderer maintains proper context state with pixel ratio

## What to Check in Browser Console:

1. Look for these console logs:
   ```
   [GameScene] Container dimensions: {...}
   [GameScene] Canvas setup complete: {...}
   [GameScene] Game initialized successfully
   [Game] First render - Player: {...}
   [Renderer] Created with canvas: {...}
   ```

2. Check if container has proper dimensions (should not be 0x0)

3. Check if any errors are preventing the game from starting

## Next Steps if Still Not Rendering:

1. Open browser DevTools and check:
   - Is the canvas element present in the DOM?
   - Does it have proper dimensions?
   - Are there any console errors?
   - Is the container background visible (should be black)?

2. Try pressing F1 to quick-start the game

3. Check if the game loop is running by looking for render logs

The canvas should now be visible with proper dimensions!
