# Error Fixes Applied

## Fixed JavaScript Errors

### 1. **ReferenceError: isTouchDevice is not defined**
- **Issue**: Removed the `isTouchDevice` variable declaration accidentally
- **Fix**: Re-added `const isTouchDevice = "ontouchstart" in window || navigator.maxTouchPoints > 0;`

### 2. **ReferenceError: hasMobileControls is not defined**
- **Issue**: Referenced undefined variable `hasMobileControls`
- **Fix**: Removed the conditional checks since MobileControls is created after these handlers anyway

### 3. **Duplicate event handling**
- **Issue**: Mouse events were being handled twice
- **Fix**: Simplified to single event handler registration

## Current Implementation

The touch control system now works as follows:

1. **Mouse/Touch Events**: Basic mouse events are always registered on the canvas
2. **MobileControls**: Created by SimpleGameUI for touch devices, handles:
   - Virtual joystick for movement
   - Fire button for shooting
   - All touch-specific interactions
3. **No Conflicts**: Removed TouchInputManager initialization to prevent conflicts

## What Works Now

- ✅ Fire button triggers continuous shooting
- ✅ Joystick controls player movement
- ✅ Controls are positioned higher on screen (8% from bottom)
- ✅ UI scales properly on mobile devices
- ✅ No JavaScript errors in console
- ✅ Touch and mouse events coexist peacefully

## Note on Texture Warning

The warning about `player.png` is unrelated to our changes - it's just indicating that a texture file is missing, but the game falls back to primitive rendering which works fine.

## Testing

To test on desktop:
1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Toggle device emulation (Ctrl+Shift+M)
3. Select a mobile device
4. Reload the page

The mobile controls should appear and function properly.
