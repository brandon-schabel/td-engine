# Wave TD Release Process

## Quick Start

To create a new release:

```bash
# 1. Update version in package.json and src-tauri/tauri.conf.json
# 2. Commit your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Bump version to v1.0.0"

# 3. Create and push a tag
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release version 1.0.0"
git push origin main
git push origin v1.0.0
