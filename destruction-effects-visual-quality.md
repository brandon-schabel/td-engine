# Destruction Effects Visual Quality Integration

## Overview
This document describes the implementation of visual quality-based particle multipliers for destruction effects in the Wave TD game.

## Changes Made

### 1. Game.ts Updates
- Modified enemy destruction effect creation to pass the particle multiplier from visual quality settings
- Modified tower destruction effect creation to use the `DestructionEffect` class with particle multiplier
- Removed the old custom `createTowerDestructionEffect` method that used floating UI particles

### 2. Enemy.ts Updates  
- Updated `createDestructionEffect` method to accept an optional `particleMultiplier` parameter
- The method now passes this multiplier to the `DestructionEffect` constructor

### 3. DestructionEffect.ts
- Already had support for particle multiplier in the constructor
- Particle counts are scaled based on the multiplier:
  - LOW quality: 0.3x particles
  - MEDIUM quality: 1.0x particles  
  - HIGH quality: 1.5x particles
- Ensures at least 1 particle is created even with very low multipliers

### 4. Visual Quality Configuration
- Uses `VISUAL_QUALITY_CONFIGS` from GameSettings.ts
- The `particleCount` property provides the multiplier for each quality level

## Implementation Details

### Particle Count Calculation
```typescript
// Base particle counts by enemy type
BASIC: 15 particles
FAST: 10 particles
TANK: 20 particles + 5 debris chunks

// Example with LOW quality (0.3 multiplier)
BASIC: Math.floor(15 * 0.3) = 4 particles
FAST: Math.floor(10 * 0.3) = 3 particles
TANK: Math.floor(20 * 0.3) + Math.floor(5 * 0.3) = 6 + 1 = 7 particles
```

### Rendering Integration
- The Renderer already checks `renderSettings.enableParticles` before rendering destruction effects
- When particle effects are disabled in settings, destruction effects won't be rendered at all

## Testing
- Created comprehensive unit tests for `DestructionEffect` class
- Created integration tests verifying visual quality configs work correctly
- All tests pass successfully

## Performance Impact
- LOW quality reduces particle count by 70%, significantly improving performance
- MEDIUM quality maintains standard particle counts
- HIGH quality increases particles by 50% for enhanced visual effects

## Code Quality
- No TypeScript errors
- Follows existing patterns in the codebase
- Maintains backward compatibility with default multiplier of 1.0
