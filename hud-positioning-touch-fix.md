# HUD Positioning and Touch Support Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. Improved Touch Event Handling in FloatingUIElement.ts
- Only prevent default for touch events, not mouse events
- Added `stopPropagation()` for touch move events to prevent conflicts with game canvas
- Added visual feedback with scale transform when dragging on touch devices
- Properly reset transform when drag ends

### 2. Adjusted Default HUD Element Positions
- **Currency Display**: Changed from 10px to 80px padding (top-left corner)
- **Player Level Display**: Changed from 10px to 50px padding (top-right corner)
- **PersistentPositionManager**: Changed default margin from 10px to 50px

### 3. Enhanced Touch Support in Styles
- Added `touch-action: none` to draggable elements to prevent default touch behaviors
- Added touch-specific visual feedback with `:active` state
- Ensured minimum touch target size of 44x44px
- Added proper touch-action CSS properties

### 4. Additional Touch Improvements
- Set `touchAction = 'none'` on draggable elements in JavaScript
- Better separation of touch and mouse event handling
- Improved visual feedback during touch interactions

## Expected Behavior
- HUD elements now appear 50-80 pixels from screen edges instead of 10px
- Touch dragging should work smoothly without triggering scroll or zoom
- Visual feedback (slight scale) when touching draggable elements
- No conflicts between touch dragging and game canvas interactions

## Testing
1. On desktop: Verify HUD elements are positioned with proper padding
2. On mobile/touchscreen: 
   - Try dragging the currency and player level displays
   - Verify smooth dragging without page scroll/zoom
   - Check visual feedback on touch
